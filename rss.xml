            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This Solar-Powered Engine Can Be Made With A 3D Printer</h1><p>You can 3D print plenty of things these days, from candy to a model of an asteroid. And now, with the help of a 3D printer, you can produce most of the parts for a pretty simple engine. Recently, German engineer Andreas Haeuser built a solar-powered Stirling engine using almost entirely 3D printed parts.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd95eff288547489f1e0bf6bb3dea00a6531c985.jpg"></article>]]></description>
